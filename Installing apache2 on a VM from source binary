1- Download and extract the apache package
Download the Apache source code under the /usr/local/src/ directory. 

a. Change the directory to src
cd /usr/local/src/

b. Use wget to download the Apache source code package (install wget if needed > sudo apt-get install wget)
Example (change version as required):
sudo wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/httpd/httpd-2.4.54.tar.gz

c. Unzip the archive file and get inside the directory
Unzip the downloaded package. Package will be unzipped into a directory
sudo tar -xf httpd-2.4.54.tar.gz

Change the directory
cd httpd-2.4.54

2- build the installation package from the source
Build the installation package from the source using the configuration command

a. Create a new directory for the installation. We can’t install Apache in the same directory we have the source.
sudo mkdir /usr/local/apache2.4.54

b. Use configure command to build the installation package. Specify the installation directory with –prefix parameter.
./configure –-prefix=/usr/local/apache2.4.54 –-enable-shared=max

(if an error appears then you should fix this by installing these packages)
sudo apt install -y build-essential libssl-dev libexpat-dev libpcre3-dev libapr1-dev libaprutil1-dev

3- Install the apache from the build
After the build is successful run:
make && make install


4- Run the Apache service
You can start, stop, restart the Apache server with apachectl command from its bin directory.

/usr/local/apache2.4.50/bin/apachectl start
/usr/local/apache2.4.50/bin/apachectl stop
/usr/local/apache2.4.50/bin/apachectl restart

5- To check the status of the Apache service, run:

ps -ef | grep apache2
