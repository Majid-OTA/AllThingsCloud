1- Download and extract the apache package
Download the Apache source code under the /usr/local/src/ directory. 

a. Change the directory to src
cd /usr/local/src/

b. Use wget to download the Apache source code package (install wget if needed > sudo apt-get install wget)
Example (change version as required):
sudo wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/httpd/httpd-2.4.54.tar.gz

c. Unzip the archive file and get inside the directory
Unzip the downloaded package. Package will be unzipped into a directory
sudo tar -xf httpd-2.4.54.tar.gz

Change the directory
cd httpd-2.4.54

2- build the installation package from the source
Build the installation package from the source using the configuration command

a. Create a new directory for the installation. We can’t install Apache in the same directory where we have the source.
sudo mkdir /usr/local/apache2.4.54

b. Use configure command to build the installation package. Specify the installation directory with –prefix parameter.
sudo ./configure –-prefix=/usr/local/apache2.4.54 –-enable-shared=max
## (Retype the flags manualy and not copying them if you get this "error: invalid variable name")

## (if another error while building appears then you should fix this by installing these packages)
sudo apt install -y build-essential libssl-dev libexpat-dev libpcre3-dev libapr1-dev libaprutil1-dev

3- Install the apache from the build
After the build is successful run:
sudo make && sudo make install


4- Run the Apache service
You can start, stop, restart the Apache server with apachectl command from its bin directory:

sudo /usr/local/apache2.4.54/bin/apachectl start
sudo /usr/local/apache2.4.54/bin/apachectl stop
sudo /usr/local/apache2.4.54/bin/apachectl restart

5- To check the status of the Apache service, run:

ps -ef | grep apache2

6- Confuguring an init.d to make sure the apache2 service runs at startup:
cd /etc/init.d && ls
# You'll see that there is no apache2 configuration file, You want to add its init script to the appropriate run level.
The init script is typically /etc/init.d/apache2 where you could manually run /etc/init.d/apache2 start to start it.

We need to add that script first:
sudo nano /etc/init.d/apache2 (edit it as shown below)
#!/bin/bash
#
# apache2        Startup script for the Apache HTTP Server
#
# chkconfig: 3 85 15
# description: Apache is a World Wide Web server.  It is used to serve \
# HTML files and CGI.

/usr/local/apache2.4.54/bin/apachectl $@


sudo chmod 755 /etc/init.d/apache2
sudo update-rc.d apache2 defaults
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start

to make sure the service is running run:
sudo ps -ef | grep httpd
